# hash-id
## Overview
This project is an example of how to upload a PDF file, mint it as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), and interact with the Ethereum blockchain using MetaMask. The application enables users to connect their MetaMask wallet, upload PDF files, mint these files as NFTs, and search/view owned NFTs.
## Features
- Connect MetaMask Wallet: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the application.
- Upload and Mint PDF Files: Users can upload PDF files and mint them as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Search NFTs: Users can search for NFTs by file hash.
- View Owned NFTs: Users can view NFTs they own.
## Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites:
    - Ensure you have MetaMask installed in your browser.
    - Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet with some test Ether for gas fees.
      
2. File Structure:
    - index.html: The main file to open in a web browser.

3. MetaMask Configuration:
    - Open MetaMask and connect to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., Ropsten Testnet).

4. Running the Application:
   - Open index.html in a web browser.
    - Click on "Connect MetaMask" to connect your wallet.
    - Upload a PDF file and click on "Mint PDF" to mint it as an NFT.
## Important Considerations
- Soulbound Tokens:
  - The minted NFTs are soulbound tokens, meaning they cannot be transferred to another address. This ensures that the ownership of the NFT remains with the original minter.
